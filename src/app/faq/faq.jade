    h3 Can I rent out my personal car?
    p
      | Unfortunately, not at this time. Due to strict registration and insurance requirements in New York City,
      |  we require all vehicles to be registered with the TLC and retain adequate commercial liability insurance.
      |  We can however, help you obtain these for your personal vehicle.
      |  Please contact us if you would like assistance with registration at support@idlecars.com.

    h3 What do you charge?
    p
      | We currently keep between 6-10% of each rental booked through Idle Cars.
      |  All rental payments and registration is done through our online marketplace.

  section
    h3 Who sets the price of the rental?
    p
      | You do! As the owner of the vehicle, it is your decision of the price to list the vehicle.
      |  We do often make suggested prices based on volume, seasonality, demand, make, model and year of vehicle,
      |  but it is always up to the owner to determine the final price of the rental.

  section
    h3 Can I negotiate with the driver?
    p
      | No. We do not allow negotiations, haggling, or switching the price after it is listed.
      |  You may however, contact us to inform us you would like to update your listings.
      |  Users who are found to be haggling or negotiating are immediately removed from the marketplace.

  section
    h3 How do I pay taxes on the rental?
    p
      | Our payment solutions provider, Braintree, will generate 1099 forms for all market participants
      |  and we will distribute these to you, as sellers on the marketplace, at the end of each year.

  section
    h3 What if a driver has tolls, tickets, or fines
    p
      | As part of our #[a(ui-sref='terms') terms of service], in the event an owner of the vehicle receives any tickets,
      |  unpaid tolls, or fines, Idle Cars reserves the right to review and may immediately charge the driver’s
